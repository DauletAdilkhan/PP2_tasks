#Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

#With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:

newlist1 = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

print(newlist1)
